# refresh-pedals.yml
#
# Runs every Monday at 06:00 UTC.
# Downloads the latest pedals.json from PedalPlayground and commits it if
# anything changed. The commit triggers Vercel's GitHub integration, which
# kicks off a fresh build and deploy automatically — no extra config needed.
#
# No secrets required: the workflow only reads a public URL and commits to
# the same repo it's running in (using the built-in GITHUB_TOKEN).
